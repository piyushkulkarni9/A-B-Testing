A/B Testing

The experiment tries to answer the following question:
Can sales be increased by adding a product video along with pictures on an e-commerce website?

Field Experiment Setting 
Field study on a mid-size women’s fashion apparel retailer in the US 
◦Annual Revenue ~ US $300 million
◦Multi-channel retail ~ over 300 stores, catalogues, and website


Examined online spring collection sales (Jan –July 2012)
◦Products organized category-wise on the firm’s website
◦Each product has a product page

Focal -Coordinating Products Association
All products are focal product on their product page
Only some products have associated coordinating products 
◦347 have associated coordinating products
◦224 have no associated coordinating products
Not all products appear as coordinating products
◦216 appear as coordinating products
◦355 do not appear as coordinating products


We want to assign products to the control group and treatment group. A video will be created and added to the product page for treatment group products -exactly as the retailer would do in practice

Suppose there are 58 products in the treatment group and 239 products in the control group
These sample sizes are not too large
Therefore, it is possible that by chance the treatment group products and the control group products are slightly “different”.  Sampling Variation
